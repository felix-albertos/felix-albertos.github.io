Trivial exercise in Python
</h2>

<p>Teaching is a never ending journey. Indeed, keeping up to date on
methodologies, technologies, …, specially in a computer science
curricula, is challenging if not impossible!</p>
<p>This year I’m working on introducing new contents into my subjects,
as always. It is a never ending process<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. It
is a process of analyzing the state of the art, the “up to date”,
“emerging”, “on the edge” topics that will help our students to build a
competitive cv.</p>
<p>Programming is one of the topics that most of our students are
interested on. Me too. It was one of the core things that push me to
make a career in computer science. And I’ve learn, and work, in many
languages, frameworks, platforms and paradigms. But I’ve always been a
“Web oriented developer”. As I always say when some one talks me about
making an application: <em>Let’s make a Web Application!</em></p>
<p>But this time, I’ve taken some time to learn something I’ve been
always interested on, <em>Python</em>. I’ve never have an excuse to
learn it, neither the need. But finally, I’ve taken some time and learn
the core basics. As a result, here is a trivial exercise in Python that
I’ve previously developed in many other languages. In fact, I’ve also
proposed this exercise to my students, or at least part of it: let’s
make a triangle, or a square, or why not, a star. It is one of the most
basic exercise to begin with with any language. It forces you to put in
practice some of the basic concepts related with input/output, structure
controls and functions (or modules).</p>
<p>As follows, it is depicted an execution of the program:</p>
