<p>Félix Albertos Marco defended his doctoral dissertation
<strong>“Responsive Web Interaction: Dynamic Management of the
Interaction in Web Applications”</strong> <span class="citation"
data-cites="fam2017thesis">[1]</span> in Novembre 2017.</p>
<p>On his thesis, he showed how Internet has made interaction with Web
applications possible from almost anywhere and using any device. As a
result, we can use the Web platform to perform tasks using multiple
devices in a coordinated manner, utilizing the interactive resources
distributed among them and, moreover, in situations where there are
connectivity issues.</p>
<p>In recent years, many theoretical and practical proposals have
focused on managing these complex interactive scenarios. However, issues
in this regard remain unsolved. Consequently, it seems necessary to
analyse and develop new proposals that further study how to dynamically
manage interaction on Web applications using the basic elements of which
they are comprised.</p>
<p>An analysis of previous proposals, both theoretical and
technological, has been conducted to support the main ideas that drive
our research. These are related to the management of connectivity issues
and multi-device environments, particularly in Web applications. Most of
the proposals to enable interaction among many devices focus on
splitting the user interface in several parts that are copied and/or
moved and on preserving a coherent state of the system to complete
users’ tasks in multi-device environments. Very few of the proposals
address defining and enabling the management of interactive events,
considering connectivity to the system and multi-device
configuration.</p>
<p>Before developing the core part of our work, we have made some
theoretical and practical proposals to obtain preliminary results that
allow us to continue with our research. These works constitute the basis
of our proposal for the dynamic management of interaction. From these
works, we conclude that the basic elements of the Web, those that allow
user interaction, do not take into account the peculiarities of
multi-device environments and offline scenarios.</p>
<p><strong>Responsive Web Interaction</strong> is proposed to perform
the dynamic management of interaction in Web applications. It focuses on
presentation and navigation levels for the description of the
interaction in current scenarios. This proposal is formalised through a
model that permits the description of the interaction in Web
applications at navigation and presentation levels.</p>
<p>The next step is to use our model, and thus test it, in several Web
scenarios. To this end, the execution of the model in real Web
applications is desirable. Therefore, two tools have been developed.
Each one focuses on one of the modelling levels of Web applications:
Proxy Offline for the navigational level and Responsive Web Interaction
Tool for the presentation level.</p>
<p>Finally, to validate our proposal, several prototypes have been
developed and evaluated in selected scenarios. Many case studies have
been selected with the aim of executing our proposal in as many
representative scenarios as possible. All these scenarios take into
account the dynamic management of the interaction in current Web
applications.</p>
